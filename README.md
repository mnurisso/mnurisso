## Hello! I'm Matteo Nurisso ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD in Physics and now a PostDoc at [CNR](https://www.isac.cnr.it/en/users/matteo-nurisso) in Turin.

I'm currently involved in the project [Destination Earth](https://destination-earth.eu/) and EPOCHAL (Earth system modeling of PaleOClimatic HyperthermALs), a project dedicated to the development of a low resolution version of [EC-EARTH4](https://ec-earth.org/) for paleoclimate purposes.

For Destination Earth I'm currently developing [AQUA](https://github.com/DestinE-Climate-DT/AQUA) (Application for QUality Assessment), a model evaluation framework designed for running diagnostics on high-resolution climate models.

What else I'm working on? Visit my [website](https://mnurisso.github.io/) to find out more about me and my projects.
